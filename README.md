# BlockChain_Java

This project showcases the implementation of a basic blockchain in Java, featuring fundamental blockchain components such as data storage, hashing, and mining mechanisms. Utilizing SHA-256 for cryptographic hashing and GSON for data serialization, this blockchain serves as an excellent educational tool for understanding the underlying technologies of distributed ledger systems.

Languages & Frameworks: Java, SHA-256, GSON

Features: 
- Block Structure: Each block contains data, the current hash, the previous hash, a nonce, and a timestamp, forming the chain's immutable structure.
- SHA-256 Hashing: Implements SHA-256 to generate secure, irreversible hashes for each block, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of the stored data.
- Blockchain Integrity: Includes mechanisms to verify the entire chain's integrity by comparing hash values, detecting any discrepancies that indicate data tampering.
- Mining Simulation: Features block mining based on a difficulty level (e.g., a hash prefix with five zeroes), challenging miners to solve complex problems to add new blocks to the chain.
- Data Serialization: Uses GSON to convert blockchain objects into a JSON format string for easy storage and transmission.

Development and Testing:
- Test Chain: A test blockchain is used to validate the functionality and performance of the system under simulated conditions.
- Mining Tests: Evaluates the mining process and difficulty adjustments to ensure stability and security as the blockchain grows.
- Integrity Checks: Regularly verifies the blockchain's integrity through comprehensive hash checks, ensuring that the chain remains secure and unaltered.
