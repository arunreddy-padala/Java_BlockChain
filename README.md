# Java_BlockChain

Langauges and Frameworks: Java, SHA-256, GSON. 

1. Designed a simple blockchain that contains individual blocks with data, current hash, previous hash, nonce, and time stamp. 
2. Designed a SHA256 algorithm that can be used for generating a blocks hash. 
3. Created a test chain to test if the blockchain works as expected. 
4. Verified the integrity of the blochchain to make sure that the data isn't tampered, by copmapring the hash values of the blocks. 
5. Added code to mine blocks based on a set difficulty number (i.e 5) of zeroes for the miners to solve. 
6. Coverted the object of the blockchain class into a string using GSON.
